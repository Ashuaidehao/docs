# Native Contracts

Neo3 provides a large number of native contracts, which are part of Neo3 NeoContract components. 

In Neo3, everything is a contract. System objects such as NEO and GAS also run in smart contracts. While it is a feasible solution to build NEO and GAS with normal smart contracts, NEO and GAS built with native contracts run much faster.
